# MNIST Digit 2 Detector

This project uses the MNIST dataset to detect whether a handwritten digit is 2. Each image is 28x28 pixels. <br> The data is split into training and testing sets, and the training set is shuffled for better performance.<br> A Logistic Regression model is trained on the binary target (2 or not 2) and evaluated using cross-validation, achieving around 97.9% accuracy.<br>

The notebook also visualizes sample digits using matplotlib, and demonstrates how to make predictions on individual images<br>
This project was completed with guidance and support from YBI Foundation, which provides hands-on training and mentorship in AI and machine learning, helping learners understand practical implementations of data science projects.
